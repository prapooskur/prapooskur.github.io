Hi there! I'm **Prasiddh**.

I'm a student currently attending Archbishop Mitty High School.

I'm currently learning Java, Python, HTML, and CSS. 

In my free time, I enjoy playing video games with friends, studying new skills, and writing code.

You can contact me through [GitHub](https://github.com/prapooskur) and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prasiddh-p-a4738a1b0/).
