Hello there! I'm **Prasiddh**, a fourth-year Computer Science student at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

I've always been fascinated by the endless possibilties offered by technology, which is why I chose to pursue a degree in computer science. So far, I've taken courses on programming fundamentals, assembly language, digital logic, and discrete mathematics, and I'm excited to learn more about the different areas of computer science in my future classes.

In my free time, I enjoy learning more about new developments in technology, exploring different programming languages and libraries, and participating in hackathons to apply the skills that I have learned.

When I'm not coding, I like to play video games and read sci-fi novels. I love exploring different worlds and concepts, and the futuristic ideas and technologies depicted in sci-fi have always been a source of inspiration to me.

After graduation, I hope to pursue a career in software engineering, systems administration, or cybersecurity.
